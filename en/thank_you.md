# Thank _you_.

Our philosophy at Ethereum is that every developer no matter what their level of technical ability should be able to create amazing things on our open-source, blockchain based platform. 

With this in mind we started this guide to help developers, from seasoned full stack developer to a complete beginner to learn how to setup the Ethereum clients, build DAPPs and in the process, learn the skills necessary to build decentralized applications on top of Ethereum.
